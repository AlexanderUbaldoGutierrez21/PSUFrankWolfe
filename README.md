# Frank Wolfe Algorithm for User Equilibrium (UE)
This project implements the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve User Equilibrium (UE) problems in transportation networks. It parses network data from a CSV file, computes shortest paths, and iteratively finds equilibrium link flows using all-or-nothing assignments and line search for convergence.

## Usage
Terminal MAC
```
python3 Frank_WolfeUE.py
```

## Academic Purposes
This code is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in transportation engineering, focusing on algorithmic clarity rather than optimized performance for large-scale networks.
